                       My name is Jacob, and I am currently an employee at IBM as a Software Developer in the cloud, and am a
                        graduate of Iowa State University with a degree in Computer Science. I’ve been interested in
                        computers since I was young, and began my studies at Iowa State in 2009. I graduated in
                        Spring of 2013, and started working at IBM in Rochester MN.</p>

                    <p>As you can tell by looking around this site, I am a computer programmer. To be more specific,
                        I have focused on Android and Cloud applications.</p>

                    <p>Feel free to take a look through my projects by visiting the link at the top of the page.
                        Also, a lot of the projects are available on my GitHub. If that is of more interest to you, please

                            <img src="img/portfolio/d1i/main-screen.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>District 1: Invasion (D1:I)</b> is a team project that I and three other students got
                               together for a class project. It is a top down shooter game written in Java that involves both
                               single and multi player. Aliens appear in waves, and it is the player’s job to shoot the aliens
                               before their health goes down to zero.</p>
                            <p>The program takes advantage of the Java Applet performance, and runs very smoothly. The player
                              is allowed to move using a/w/s/d and shoot using the mouse. The player has two slots for guns,
                              and can drop/pick up different guns found around the map (including assault rifle, pistol, sniper
                              and rocket launcher). The player also has two slots for special items (the two we implemented were
                              grenades and health packs). During multiplayer, everything is synced with all other computers, so
                              two people cannot pick up the same item. We also used 3DS Max for our game GUI animations.</p>
                            <p>Although we had a limited amount of time, we were not only able to release a full featured game,
                              but also the menus. The menus included a main screen, full tutorial, the option to choose single
                              player or multiplayer, a list to choose what game to play and a fully functional chat if multiplayer
                              is chosen.</p>
                            <p>The multiplayer was the hardest part of the game. Thankfully, one of the team members had a desktop
                              computer we used for the server, and in the end, the multiplayer ran smoothly with very little lag
                              (regardless of the bad wireless during the demo). Security and protection against SQL injection and
                              other common hacking techniques were also implemented.</p>
                            <p>We currently have three different aliens (with different HP, damage and speed), one level with one wave,
                              and five different guns. Although this may not seem like a lot, we made it modular. This means that we can
                              very easily add more waves, more levels, different maps, more aliens and different guns. If we decide to
                              take the game to the next level, it would be really easy to add more parts to make it a fully featured game.</p>
                            <p>We submitted this project for a competition against 32 other teams. We got the “Best Software Project
                              Silver Award” (missed Gold by three votes), but we were very proud to have gotten as far as we had on the
                              project, especially given our time frame and other commitments.</p>
                            <p>NOTE: Unfortunately, since the snapshots were taken after the class, I don't have any snapshots of multiplayer.
                               This means that you won’t be able to see any server side activity, including chats. Also,
                             since this wasn't a photography class, we were allowed to use any image we found online, with the understanding
                             that if we wanted to publish our work outside the class, we would need to redo the images.</p>
